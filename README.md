Meowpedia is a simple and sassy cat wiki styled with sleek cards. It lets you explore various cat breeds, learn random facts about them, and of course, favorite the floofiest ones.

## ✨ Features (or lack thereof)

* 🐱 **Card-Based UI** – Scroll through pretty cards showing info and stats about each cat breed.
* 🔍 **Search Bar** – Looking for a specific kitty? Just type away and find them instantly.
* ❤️ **Add to Favorites** – Found the one? Add them to your favorites list for quick access later.
* 🧑‍💻 **Set a Username** – Personalize your experience, because who doesn’t love seeing a little “Hello, [your name]!” greeting?

## ⚠️ Limitations

Because of how the cat API works (yes, we’re blaming them), the main page only loads up to 20 cats at a time.
But don’t worry – the search bar lets you hunt down your dream breed in no time!

## 🛠 Built With

* [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com) – for that mobile-first, responsive goodness.
* [Angular](https://angular.dev) + [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) – for reactive vibes and slick handling of API data.
* [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com) for The Cat API – for the adorable content. We love you, feline overlords.
